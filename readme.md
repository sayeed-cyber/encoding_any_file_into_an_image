# File to Image Encoder/Decoder

This project enables encoding any type of file into images and decoding them back to the original file format. It converts files into images, or multiple images if the file size is large, and then restores the original file from the images.

## Introduction

This project provides a Python script to convert files into images and back. It's particularly useful for scenarios where file storage is limited, or when sharing files in image format is more convenient.

## Applications

- **Data Hiding**: Encode sensitive files such as documents, images, or videos into images for secure transmission or storage.
- **Steganography**: Conceal data within images to hide its existence.
- **Image Compression**: Convert large files into smaller images for efficient storage.
- **Secure Transmission**: Encode files into images for transmission over platforms where certain file types are restricted.

## How it Works

The script reads the binary data of the input file and divides it into chunks. Each chunk is converted into pixel data, and images are created accordingly. For decoding, the process is reversed to reconstruct the original file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- PIL (Python Imaging Library) - Version X.X.X



# Future Enhancements

- Video Generation: Utilize encoded images to create videos, enabling efficient storage and transmission of large amounts of data.
- Encryption: Implement encryption techniques to enhance the security of the encoded data.
- Optimization: Improve encoding and decoding algorithms for better performance and efficiency.
- GUI: Develop a user-friendly graphical interface for easier interaction with the tool.
- Error Handling: Enhance error handling mechanisms to provide more informative feedback during encoding and decoding processes.
- Performance Tuning: Investigate methods to optimize processing time and resource usage.
- Support for More File Types: Expand the tool's capability to encode and decode a wider range of file types.
- Documentation: Improve documentation to provide comprehensive guidance on usage and extension of the tool.
